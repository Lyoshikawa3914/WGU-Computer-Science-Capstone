Computer Science capstone

This is my capstone for WGU that uses image recognition to classify images of happy and sad people

- main.py is the UI that allows the users to drag and drop jpeg images into the app and display the image on the app.
- CapstoneUI.ipynb is the file that allows users to drop jpeg images in to the app and have that image classified by the trained    model
- Capstone WGU.ipynb is the file that contains the training model that will classify happy and sad images
- allImages is a zip file that contains the folders of happy and sad people
